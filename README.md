1. Of all variables, vehicle_length and ground_clearance are significant in that they provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

2. The slope of this linear model is not zero, otherwise our r-squared value would be zero, or close to it. Since the multiple R-squared value for this linear model is 0.7149, it can be said that a general r value (correlation coefficient) is .85, which indicates a strong correlation. 
  
3. This model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively. Since the multiple R-squared value for this linear model is 0.7149, this means that roughly 72% of the variablilty of our mpg variable can be explained using this model.
